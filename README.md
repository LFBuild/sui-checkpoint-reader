<h3 align=center>Process sui checkpoints with ease</h3>

This library allows building custom [Sui indexers](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/advanced/custom-indexer?ref=blog.sui.io) in JavaScript. It reads checkpoint files from both remote and local sources and processes them efficiently.

> **Note:** This is a work in progress and might not be suited for production usage.

## üöÄ Getting Started

First, install the library:

```sh
npm install @aresrpg/sui-checkpoint-reader
```

Here's a basic example of how to use the library:

```js
import { read_checkpoints } from '@aresrpg/sui-checkpoint-reader'

async function get_remote_checkpoint(num) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://checkpoints.testnet.sui.io/${num}.chk`)
  const buffer = await response.arrayBuffer()
  return buffer
}

async function process_checkpoint(checkpoint, index) {
  console.log('[indexer] process_checkpoint:', index)
}

const known_types = {}

await read_checkpoints({
  from: 1, // Start processing from checkpoint 1
  to: Infinity, // Continue processing indefinitely
  get_remote_checkpoint, // Function to fetch checkpoint data
  concurrent_downloads: 25, // Number of concurrent downloads allowed
  known_types, // BCS types you want to parse
  checkpoints_folder: '', // Local folder for checkpoint files
  cleanup_checkpoints: false, // Clean up processed checkpoint files
  process_checkpoint, // Function to process each checkpoint
})
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The reader supports two modes: **remote-only** and **hybrid** (more powerful) mode.

### Hybrid Mode (with `checkpoints_folder` specified)

1. **Initial Check**: The reader will first check existing checkpoint files and determine what needs to be downloaded to fill the gap between `from` and the lowest present checkpoint file.
2. **Gap Filling**: If `from` is lower than the lowest checkpoint file, missing checkpoints will be downloaded up to the lower checkpoint file.
3. **Sequential Processing**: The reader will process checkpoints sequentially as they become available.
4. **Stopping Remote Reader**: Once all checkpoints up to the lowest file (or the `to` parameter) are downloaded, the remote reader will stop.
5. **Local File Watching**: Local checkpoint files will be watched and processed as they become available.

### Remote-Only Mode (without `checkpoints_folder`)

In this mode, the reader will rely solely on remote checkpoint files:

- **Fetching Checkpoints**: Checkpoints are fetched from the specified remote source.
- **Sequential Processing**: Checkpoints are processed in sequential order as they are downloaded.
- **Efficient Downloads**: The reader handles concurrent downloads up to the specified limit.

## Example Usage for Remote-Only Mode

```js
import { read_checkpoints } from '@aresrpg/sui-checkpoint-reader'

async function get_remote_checkpoint(num) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://checkpoints.testnet.sui.io/${num}.chk`)
  const buffer = await response.arrayBuffer()
  return buffer
}

async function process_checkpoint(checkpoint, index) {
  console.log('[indexer] process_checkpoint:', index)
}

const known_types = {}

await read_checkpoints({
  from: 1,
  get_remote_checkpoint,
  concurrent_downloads: 25,
  known_types,
  process_checkpoint,
})
```

## üß© BCS Types

To parse specific objects within the checkpoints, you can provide the BCS definitions directly.

### Generating BCS Types

You can generate the necessary types using the built-in generator. Here is an example of how to generate the BCS types for a specific package address:

```bash
npx @aresrpg/sui-checkpoint-reader gen --package <package_address> --file <output_file> --network <network_name>
```

> The `network_name` defaults to `testnet` if not provided. Not that you can also generate 0x2 types as needed

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you can define and use known BCS types:

```js
// npx @aresrpg/sui-checkpoint-reader gen --package 0x68e06aee7966648c7b3258f02d5c7da2cf9b035727d6e9167c90e662f20e0406 --file aresrpg-bcs.js --network testnet
import { read_checkpoints } from '@aresrpg/sui-checkpoint-reader'

import aresrpg_bcs from './aresrpg-bcs.js'

const ARESRPG =
  '0x68e06aee7966648c7b3258f02d5c7da2cf9b035727d6e9167c90e662f20e0406'

const known_types = {
  [ARESRPG]: aresrpg_bcs,
}
```

This configuration allows the checkpoint reader to correctly parse and process the objects within the checkpoints.

## üìñ API Reference

### `read_checkpoints(options)`

**Options:**

- `from`: Start processing from this checkpoint number (default: `1`).
- `to`: Stop processing once this checkpoint number is reached (default: `Infinity`).
- `get_remote_checkpoint`: Function to fetch a checkpoint array buffer from a number.
- `concurrent_downloads`: Number of concurrent downloads allowed while catching up (default: `25`).
- `known_types`: Generated BCS for types you want to parse.
- `checkpoints_folder`: Local folder where your Sui node is dumping the checkpoint files (default: `''`).
- `cleanup_checkpoints`: Option to delete already processed checkpoint files (default: `false`).
- `process_checkpoint`: Function to process a checkpoint.
