# Sui Checkpoint Reader üìä

This library allows building custom [Sui indexers](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/advanced/custom-indexer?ref=blog.sui.io) in JavaScript. It reads checkpoint files from both remote and local sources and processes them efficiently.

> **Note:** This is a work in progress and might not be suited for production usage.

## üöÄ Getting Started

First, install the library:

```sh
npm install @aresrpg/sui-checkpoint-reader
```

Here's a basic example of how to use the library:

```js
import { read_checkpoints } from '@aresrpg/sui-checkpoint-reader';

async function get_remote_checkpoint(num) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://checkpoints.testnet.sui.io/${num}.chk`);
  const buffer = await response.arrayBuffer();
  return buffer;
}

async function process_checkpoint(checkpoint, index) {
  console.log('[indexer] process_checkpoint:', index);
}

const known_types = {};

await read_checkpoints({
  from: 1, // Start processing from checkpoint 1
  to: Infinity, // Continue processing indefinitely
  get_remote_checkpoint, // Function to fetch checkpoint data
  concurrent_downloads: 25, // Number of concurrent downloads allowed
  known_types, // BCS types you want to parse
  checkpoints_folder: '', // Local folder for checkpoint files
  cleanup_checkpoints: false, // Clean up processed checkpoint files
  process_checkpoint, // Function to process each checkpoint
});
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The reader supports two modes: **remote-only** and **hybrid** (more powerful) mode.

### Hybrid Mode (with `checkpoints_folder` specified)

1. **Initial Check**: The reader will first check existing checkpoint files and determine what needs to be downloaded to fill the gap between `from` and the lowest present checkpoint file.
2. **Gap Filling**: If `from` is lower than the lowest checkpoint file, missing checkpoints will be downloaded up to the lower checkpoint file.
3. **Sequential Processing**: The reader will process checkpoints sequentially as they become available.
4. **Stopping Remote Reader**: Once all checkpoints up to the lowest file (or the `to` parameter) are downloaded, the remote reader will stop.
5. **Local File Watching**: Local checkpoint files will be watched and processed as they become available.

### Remote-Only Mode (without `checkpoints_folder`)

In this mode, the reader will rely solely on remote checkpoint files:

- **Fetching Checkpoints**: Checkpoints are fetched from the specified remote source.
- **Sequential Processing**: Checkpoints are processed in sequential order as they are downloaded.
- **Efficient Downloads**: The reader handles concurrent downloads up to the specified limit.

## Example Usage for Remote-Only Mode

```js
import { read_checkpoints } from '@aresrpg/sui-checkpoint-reader';

async function get_remote_checkpoint(num) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://checkpoints.testnet.sui.io/${num}.chk`);
  const buffer = await response.arrayBuffer();
  return buffer;
}

async function process_checkpoint(checkpoint, index) {
  console.log('[indexer] process_checkpoint:', index);
}

const known_types = {};

await read_checkpoints({
  from: 1,
  get_remote_checkpoint,
  concurrent_downloads: 25,
  known_types,
  process_checkpoint,
});
```

## üß© BCS Types

To parse specific objects within the checkpoints, you can provide the BCS definitions directly.

### Generating BCS Types

You can generate the necessary types using the [sui-client-gen](https://github.com/kunalabs-io/sui-client-gen) tool. Follow the instructions in the repository to generate the BCS types. Each generated type must contain a `bcs` property, which resolves to a `@mysten/bcs` type.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you can define and use known BCS types:

```js
import { ItemSplitEvent } from '../gen/aresrpg/events/structs.ts';
import { Item } from '../gen/aresrpg/item/structs.ts';
import {
  Kiosk,
  KioskOwnerCap,
  ItemListed,
} from '../gen/_dependencies/onchain/0x2/kiosk/structs.ts';
[...]

const known_types = {
  '0xd21548e4c2223ee16ddd4812b6a14f88d24976492e5653c2ef8b86fc5d678498': {
    item: {
      Item,
    },
    events: {
      ItemSplitEvent,
    },
  },
  '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002': {
    kiosk: {
      KioskOwnerCap,
      Kiosk,
      ItemListed: {
        '0xd21548e4c2223ee16ddd4812b6a14f88d24976492e5653c2ef8b86fc5d678498::item::Item':
          ItemListed,
      },
    },
    dynamic_field: {
      Field,
    },
    dynamic_object_field: {
      Wrapper,
    },
    transfer_policy: {
      TransferPolicy,
      TransferPolicyCap,
    },
    clock: { Clock },
    display: {
      Display,
    },
    package: { Publisher, UpgradeCap },
  },
  '0x06f6bdd3f2e2e759d8a4b9c252f379f7a05e72dfe4c0b9311cdac27b8eb791b1': {
    personal_kiosk: {
      PersonalKioskCap,
    },
  },
};
```

This configuration allows the checkpoint reader to correctly parse and process the objects within the checkpoints.

## üìñ API Reference

### `read_checkpoints(options)`

**Options:**

- `from`: Start processing from this checkpoint number (default: `1`).
- `to`: Stop processing once this checkpoint number is reached (default: `Infinity`).
- `get_remote_checkpoint`: Function to fetch a checkpoint array buffer from a number.
- `concurrent_downloads`: Number of concurrent downloads allowed while catching up (default: `25`).
- `known_types`: Generated BCS for types you want to parse.
- `checkpoints_folder`: Local folder where your Sui node is dumping the checkpoint files (default: `''`).
- `cleanup_checkpoints`: Option to delete already processed checkpoint files (default: `false`).
- `process_checkpoint`: Function to process a checkpoint.
